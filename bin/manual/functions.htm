<h1><a name="Edit">Menu Functions</a></h1>

EOF contains many useful functions which can be accessed through various menus. Many functions also have a keyboard shortcut to expedite the song editing process. Let's get to it.

<h1><a name="new">New</a></h1>
Create a new EOF project. You will select an OGG or MP3, choose a destination for the new project, and enter some information about the song. If the selected audio file contains tag information, the song artist, title and year will be automatically entered into the song's properties from the audio file's ID3v1/ID3v2 tag or OGG Vorbis tag comments if available. The album information will be similarly read into an INI setting if it is available. When choosing a destination for your project you have three options. "Use Existing Folder" requires you to point to an existing folder where EOF will create your project files. "Use OGG Folder" will place the project files in the folder with the OGG or MP3 file you selected. "Create New Folder" will create the folder you specify in EOF's own song folder (see <a href=functions.htm#songfolder>File>Song Folder</a>).<br><br>
Wherever you choose to store the project, the OGG file you chose will be copied to "guitar.ogg" (required by "Frets On Fire"). If you choose an MP3 file, and you have LAME and Vorbis Tools installed (included in Windows version of EOF), EOF will convert it to "guitar.ogg" using the average bitrate you specify in the "OGG Settings" dialog, automatically re-sampling the audio to 44khz if necessary. A copy of the MP3 file will also be saved as "original.mp3" in the project folder, for use with the <a href="functions.htm#silence">Leading Silence</a> feature. If you do not have LAME and Vorbis Tools installed, you will not be able to use the built-in MP3 conversion.<br>
<h1><a name="load">Load</a></h1>
Load an existing EOF project. EOF will look for a "guitar.ogg" file in the same folder as the EOF project file you loaded. If it cannot find one you will be asked to locate an OGG (or MP3, which will be converted to OGG format) file for EOF to load.<br>
<h1><a name="save">Save</a></h1>
Save the current EOF project. When saving a project EOF automatically generates all the files needed for the song to work in "Frets On Fire."<br>
<h1><a name="saveas">Save As</a></h1>
Save the current EOF project to a new location. Subsequent "Save" requests will write the song files to the new location. If no "guitar.ogg" exists in the destination folder, EOF will create one using the currently loaded OGG file.<br>
<h1><a name="loadogg">Load OGG</a></h1>
Load a new OGG file into the current project. If your song has separate audio for the guitar or other instrument you are fretting you can use this function to switch out the audio.<br><br>
EOF keeps separate "Delay" settings for each differently named OGG file you load. This allows you to use tracks of differing length without having to adjust the delay and notes each time you swap OGG files. This is useful if you have two different versions of the same song, perhaps a karaoke version without vocals and a normal version. Setting up the "Delay" for each file will automatically move the beats and notes to the correct place each time you use "Load OGG" to swap them out.<br>
<h1><a name="midiimport">MIDI Import</a></h1>
Create a new EOF project from an existing MIDI file.  This function is useful if you want to edit a song which was not created in EOF or if you want to alter a chart where the EOF file is not available. Tracks are imported from the MIDI file and song properties are loaded from "song.ini" if it exists.  A Rock Band Audition (RBA) file contains a chart that was authored for Rock Band Network (RBN).  EOF provides the ability to open the MIDI data from this type of file the same way as a normal Rock Band MIDI.  EOF will look for a "guitar.ogg" file in the same folder as the MIDI file you loaded. If it cannot find one you will be asked to locate an OGG (or MP3, which will be converted to OGG format) file for EOF to load.<br><br>
If bass notes in lane 1 are found to have forced HOPO on phrases, EOF will prompt about whether to import these as open strum bass notes (see <a href="functions.htm#openbass">Enable open strum bass</a>).  If the "sysex_open_bass = True" tag is found in the imported MIDI's song.ini file, such notes will be imported as open strum bass notes automatically without prompting.<br><br>
If an imported MIDI has yellow, blue or purple drum notes and no tom phrases, EOF will import them as cymbals instead of toms if the "pro_drums = True" tag is found in the imported MIDI's song.ini file.  This tag allows a chart with all cymbals to be correctly identified and differentiated from a chart with all tom drums.  This serves as a workaround to Harmonix's goof that in pro drums, all yellow, blue and green drums are treated as cymbals by default, which introduced a significant amount of Rock Band Network charts that do not play correctly in regards to pro drums.<br><br>
If any unsupported (yet recognizable as Rock Band related) MIDI tracks are encountered (pro keys, harmony vocal tracks), EOF will offer to store them into the project instead of just ignore them.  Each event in the stored MIDI tracks is stored in high precision millisecond timing, and is saved to the output MIDI during project save conforming to the chart's tempo map.  This functionality should be useful for importing a MIDI that uses unusual tempo mapping (like ones with mid-beat tempo/TS changes) for the purposes of adding a pro guitar upgrade, adding new instrument tracks to a chart by importing a MIDI that has pro keys/harmonies or simply synchronizing a chart with audio.  The stored MIDI tracks can be listed/deleted via the <a href="functions.htm#rawmidi">Songs>"Manage raw MIDI tracks"</a> menu function.<br>
<h1><a name="dbimport">Feedback Import</a></h1>
Create a new EOF project from an existing Feedback chart file.  This type of file (typically has a ".chart" file extension) is a chart format generally created using the Feedback chart editor and was originally intended for creating custom charts for Guitar Hero.  Various conversion utilities have been created previously allowing people to convert these charts into a MIDI file usable in Frets on Fire.  This function allows Feedback charts to be imported.  It will look in the chart's folder to try to load whichever audio file is specified by the chart (MP3 and OGG are supported).  If that file is not present, it will try to open guitar.ogg.  If that file is not present, if the chart's folder only has one OGG file in it, it will try to open that file.  If there is no OGG file in the folder, or if there are multiple OGG files to choose from, EOF will have you browse for the audio file to use.  Feedback charts containing non-standard 5 lane drums are supported.  Section markers that are imported will be altered as necessary to make them comply with the "[section SECTION_NAME]" naming convention.  Any [solo_on] and [solo_off] events that are imported are converted into solo sections for guitar (PART GUITAR) and lead guitar (PART GUITAR COOP).<br>
<h1><a name="ghimport">GH Import</a></h1>
Create a new EOF project from an existing Guitar Hero note file.  This type of file (often with an extension such as .pak.ngc) is common when working with custom charts for Guitar Hero.  This format usually contains guitar, bass and star power phrases.  It can also contain slider guitar sections, drum notes, drum rolls/swells and pitched lyrics.  The aim for this import function is to get a true one to one conversion, and forced HOPO notes are imported as such.  In Guitar Hero, all notes that are not explicitly HOPO on must be strummed, but EOF will prompt about whether or not such notes will be imported with HOPO off notation.  Drum rolls/swells are conceptually similar to drum rolls and special drum rolls in Rock Band standards, but in Guitar Hero, these phrases are marked as long drum notes instead of having a special phrase.  Lyric phrases will also be trimmed to fit the lyrics they contain, and empty phrases will be removed.  EOF will look for a "guitar.ogg" file in the same folder as the MIDI file you loaded. If it cannot find one you will be asked to locate an OGG (or MP3, which will be converted to OGG format) file for EOF to load.  If the imported Guitar Hero file is in QB format (ie. pre GH5), EOF will add a "drum_fallback_blue = True" INI entry if any drum gems are imported.  This tag will be used in future versions of Phase Shift to decide how to down-chart a 5 lane drum chart to play on a 4 lane drum kit (ie. to mimic how Guitar Hero would handle it).<br>
<h1><a name="lyricimport">Lyric Import</a></h1>
Imports lyrics from an existing file into the current EOF project.  See the <a href="../vocaltutorial/index.htm#import">Lyric import</a> section of the vocal tutorial for details.<br>
<h1><a name="settings">Settings</a></h1>
Change the program settings. See <a href="configure.htm">Configuring EOF</a> for details<br>
<h1><a name="preferences">Preferences</a></h1>
Change the user preferences. See <a href="configure.htm#preferences">Configuring EOF</a> for details<br>
<h1><a name="display">Display</a></h1>
Change the size of the EOF window.<br>
<h1><a name="controllers">Controllers</a></h1>
Configure guitar and drum controllers. These can be used in tandem with the "Guitar Tap" and "Guitar Strum" edit modes.<br>
<h1><a name="songfolder">Song Folder</a></h1>
Tell EOF the base folder where to save new projects. New projects created with the "Create New Folder" option will be created in a folder inside of the base folder. For example, if you select "C:\games\fof\wipsongs" for the base folder and create a new project with "Create New Folder" and "my new song" as the new folder name, the project will be stored in "c:\games\fof\wipsongs\my new song\"<br>
<h1><a name="linktofof">Link to FOF</a></h1>
Allows you to link EOF to "Frets On Fire" if you are using a mod which allows starting a song from the command line (RF or FoFiX for example). You will first locate "FretsOnFire.exe" and then select the location of the song library (the base song folder). If done correctly, you will be able to launch FOF with the currently open song for testing (see <a href="functions.htm#testinfof">Song>Test In FOF</a>).<br>
<h1><a name="linktops">Link to Phase Shift</a></h1>
Allows you to link EOF to Phase Shift, which will start a song from the command line.  You will first locate "Phase Shift.exe" and then select the location of the song library.  If done correctly, you will be able to launch Phase Shift with the currently open song for testing (see <a href="functions.htm#testinps">Song>Test in Phase Shift</a>).<br>
<h1><a name="exit">Exit</a></h1>
Close EOF. If you have unsaved changes you will be prompted to save.<br>

<blockquote>
<h1><a name="undo">Undo</a></h1>
Undo the previous operation. You can undo up to 100 operations.<br>
<h1><a name="redo">Redo</a></h1>
Redo the previously undone operation.<br>
<h1><a name="copy">Copy</a></h1>
Copy the currently selected notes to the clipboard (see <a href="edit.htm">Editing Songs</a>). The clipboard is shared between all instances of EOF. If you copy notes in one instance, you can paste them into another instance. If you copy notes in both instances, only the most recently copied notes will be in the clipboard. Copied notes' HOPO, "crazy" and double bass statuses are kept on the clipboard and are applied to the pasted notes accordingly.<br>
<h1><a name="paste">Paste</a></h1>
Paste notes from the clipboard. Note positions and lengths are pasted relative to the beat markers meaning pasted notes will stretch and shrink depending on the BPM of the beats being pasted into. Pasted notes will begin at the beat in which the position line lies and continue on through subsequent beats.  This allows pasted notes to retain their original grid snap positions even when you are pasting into beats that have different tempos than the copied notes.  By default, pasted notes merge with any notes that already exist, with the pasted notes winning any contention for statuses (ie. if a normal yellow gem is pasted onto a yellow cymbal, the result is a normal yellow gem).  Alternatively, if the <a href="configure.htm#preferences">"Erase overlapped pasted notes"</a> preference is enabled, any note that is within the range of the chart that would be altered by a paste operation are deleted.<br>
<h1><a name="oldpaste">Old Paste</a></h1>
The same as "Paste" except the note positions and lengths are not scaled to fit into the beats. The notes will remain exactly as they were copied and the first note will be pasted exactly on the position line.<br>
<h1><a name="pastefrom">Paste From</a></h1>
Paste notes from other locations.  "Paste From>Supaeasy/Easy/Medium/Amazing" copies all notes from the desired difficulty to the currently selected difficulty (useful for downgrading songs to lower difficulties).  "Paste From>Catalog" pastes notes from the currently selected catalog entry.  If the <a href="configure.htm#preferences">"Erase overlapped pasted notes"</a> preference is not enabled, paste from catalog will stop pasting notes early if it reaches a beat that has notes in it, to prevent notes from being overlapped.<br>
<h1><a name="gridsnap">Grid Snap</a></h1>
Change the current grid snap setting. Grid snap forces note placement to the specified setting. If you have created a tempo map for your song, turning grid snap to an appropriate setting will save you lots of time when placing notes.<br><br>
A grid snap setting of 1/4 means that each grid snap position occurs at 1/4 of a measure intervals. With this setting you can fit up to four separate notes into one measure. A grid snap setting of 1/8 means that each grid snap position occurs at 1/8 of a measure intervals and so on and so forth. Using a custom grid snap level, you can define the number of intervals per beat or per measure. Keep in mind that if you supply a custom "per measure" grid snap, you must also place time signatures where appropriate, in order to define the number of beats per measure.  Otherwise, one beat per measure will be assumed. Currently, a limit of 64 intervals is in place, because using higher values will rarely be practical.<br>
<h1><a name="zoom">Zoom</a></h1>
Change the zoom level of the fretboard editing area. For faster songs, zooming in can help with note placement.<br>
<h1><a name="speed">Preview Speed</a></h1>
Change the speed of the fretboard in the 3D Preview.<br>
<h1><a name="playbackrate">Playback Rate</a></h1>
Change the speed of the audio playback. For fast solo sections it can be useful to play the song back at a slower speed to make it easier to hear the notes in the song. You can play the song back at 50% speed without changing the setting by holding the Ctrl key while pressing the play button. You can play the song back at 100% speed without changing the setting by holding the D key while beginning playback. You can also specify a custom playback by specifying the percentage of full speed it should play back, such as 30 or 200.<br>
<h1><a name="phopo">Preview HOPO</a></h1>
Select the algorithm used to determine which notes display as HO/PO notes in EOF's 3D preview panel. RF is equivalent to "Guitar Hero 2." If you are using RF-Mod or FoFiX you should use this setting. FOF is for standard "Frets On Fire." Manual will only show notes within forced HO/PO On phrases as HO/PO notes, making it more useful for authoring in Rock Band or other rhythm games that may support this notation, as well as to future-proof your chart should FoFiX eventually support forced HO/PO On/Off phrases.  An important note: HO/PO notes are determined by an algorithm in all current versions of FOF, FoFiX and all current mods, so what EOF shows is not necessarily what the user will see in-game in regard to HO/PO notes.  What the players receive for HO/PO notes depends on their settings and what version of the game they are using. In order for a note to be a HO/PO note in FoF, it normally has to be within 1/12th measure or less of the previous note. Turning on the "Eighth Note HO/PO" setting in "Song Properties" will change the HO/PO note threshold to 1/8th instead, for mods that support the "Eighth Note HO/PO" song.ini file setting.<br>
<h1><a name="metronome">Metronome</a></h1>
Toggle the metronome. When the metronome is on, a tick will sound at every beat marker during audio playback. This feature is useful when you are creating a tempo map for your song. See <a href="../tutorial/index.htm#tempomap">Creating a Tempo Map</a> for a demonstration of how to use this feature.<br>
<h1><a name="claps">Claps</a></h1>
Toggle note claps. When note claps are on, a clap will sound at every note during audio playback. This feature is useful to ensure your notes are synchronized with the audio in the song. If your notes are placed correctly, the clap should sound at the same time each note is audible.<br>
<h1><a name="clapnotes">Clap Notes</a></h1>
Select a specific gem color you want to trigger claps.<br>
<h1><a name="tones">Vocal Tones</a></h1>
Enables or disables the sounding of piano tones in PART VOCALS.  See the <a href="../vocaltutorial/index.htm#testing1">Testing and editing lyric pitches</a> section of the vocal tutorial for details.<br>
<h1><a name="miditones">MIDI Tones</a></h1>
(Currently incomplete)
<h1><a name="bookmark">Bookmark</a></h1>
Place a bookmark at the current location of the position line. You can seek directly to your bookmarks (see <a href="functions.htm#seek">Song>Seek</a>) at any time. If you are going to be seeking to a specific part of a song multiple times, having a bookmark there can save lots of time.<br>
<h1><a name="selection">Selection</a></h1>
Perform various select operations. "Select All" selects all the notes in the current difficulty. "Select Like" selects notes which match any of the currently selected notes. "Select Rest" selects all notes from the currently selected note to the end of the song. "Deselect All" deselects all notes.  "Select Previous" selects all notes from the beginning of the song to the currently selected note.<br>

<blockquote>
<h1><a name="seek">Seek</a></h1>
Perform various seek operations. Seeking moves the position line to the desired location.<br>
<h1><a name="track">Track</a></h1>
Select a track for editing. PART GUITAR is the default track. Tracks containing notes will have an asterisk (*) displayed next to them.  All tracks are edited in a similar way.  Some tracks such as PART DRUMS and PART DANCE will appear differently in the piano roll and the 3D Preview.<br>
<h1><a name="fileinfo">File Info</a></h1>
Display various information about the current project.<br>
<h1><a name="audiocues">Audio cues</a></h1>
Opens a dialog window allowing you to change the volume for the chart audio and any of EOF's audio cues:  Clap, metronome, vocal tone and vocal percussion.  This will affect the volume of the cue when it is sounded during playback or when the chart is stopped (such as when clicking on a lyric or vocal percussion note).  This dialog window also allows you to select the sound that will be used for a vocal percussion note.  See <a href="../vocaltutorial/index.htm#percussion">Percussion sections</a> in the vocal tutorial for details.<br>
<h1><a name="semitones">Display semitones as flat</a></h1>
Displays note names with flat notation instead of sharp notation.  See the <a href="../vocaltutorial/index.htm#advanced">Advanced topics</a> section of the vocal tutorial for details.<br>
<h1><a name="sequence">Create image sequence</a></h1>
If you wanted to create a video of your chart, you may be worried about lag when using screen recording software. EOF has a solution to that problem by allowing you to create an image sequence (one PCX format image file for each frame of the chart, at a rate of 30 FPS). The PCX files are created with incrementing file names in a "sequence" sub folder of your chart's project folder. You can use the free VirtualDubMod (http://virtualdubmod.sourceforge.net/) application to create a video out of this sequence:<br>
<blockquote>
1.  Open the image sequence (in VirtualDubMod, open File>Open video file and select the lowest number PCX file in the sequence. It will automatically load the other PCX files (as long as you don't disable the "Automatically load linked segments" option) as raw video frames.<br>
2.  Open Video>Frame Rate and change the source rate to 30 to match the 30FPS that EOF exported with.<br>
3.  Select your desired compression/filter/etc. settings in the Video menu. I usually go with the Xvid codec and perform two passes. For the first pass, select "Twopass - 1st pass" in the Xvid configuration options and then select "Save as" from the file menu. Then for the second pass, without changing any other settings, go back to Xvid configuration options and select "Twopass - 2nd pass". This time, you have to specify a target bitrate. Sometimes if I feel too lazy to pick a bitrate, I use the average bitrate given by the Xvid status window from the first pass, but you can pick any valid bitrate you want and then use File>Save as to overwrite the file created in the first pass of the compression. When it completes, you will have a video file without audio.<br>
4. Use your favorite video editing application to "mux" in the audio for your chart. I usually go with one of the other VirtualDub releases (http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/) or (http://home.comcast.net/~fcchandler/stable/) for this because handling audio streams in VirtualDubMod just seems more complicated to me. You may need to convert your chart's audio to regular WAV format for this step, depending on the tool you are using. In VirtualDub, you would open the Audio menu, select "WAV Audio" and select your chart audio file. If you do provide the audio as a WAV file, make sure to enable the audio to be compressed again by selecting Audio>Full Processing Mode, then Audio>Compression and select your desired codec and settings. I usually use LAME MP3 and a constant (CBR) bitrate setting, constant bitrate is more reliable for audio/video synchronization in general.<br>
5.  You can show the finished video to your friends, upload it someplace like Youtube or whatever you want.<br>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="waveform">Waveform graph</a></h1>
Provides the ability to show, hide and configure a waveform graph for the currently active OGG file.  To generate the graph, use the "Show" item in this menu or simply press the F5 key when the chart is not playing.  After a few seconds, the graph will be displayed as per the settings in the "Configure" dialog menu.  For each vertical slice (one pixel wide) of the graph, the minimum amplitude in that portion of the audio (rendered in dark green by default), the peak (maximum) amplitude (rendered in light green by default) and the root mean square (think of this as the average) amplitude (rendered in red by default) are displayed.  In the "Configure" menu item, you can specify whether the left audio channel, the right audio channel or both audio channels will be graphed.  You can also specify whether the graph will be scaled to fit within the fretboard area or the entire editor window (the area above the scroll bar and the below the playback control buttons).  When both the left and right channels are being graphed, the left channel is drawn on top of the right channel.  Once the waveform graph has been initially generated, you can show/hide it with the F5 key.  If you load another OGG file (see <a href="functions.htm#loadogg">File>Load OGG</a>), the waveform graph will not be recreated until it is hidden and shown again.  This will, for example, allow you to generate a graph for a drum track and then load another audio file.  If you load or import a chart, any existing waveform graph will be discarded and will need to be created again by showing the graph.<br><br>
The default colors can be altered by editing the eof.cfg file that EOF creates in its program folder when it exits.  The colors are defined in hexadecimal in standard RGB format where each color intensity is a two digit value from 00 (none) to FF (maximum).  The first two digits are the red intensity, the second set of two digits are the green intensity and the third set of two digits are the blue intensity.  If an RGB value has leading zeros, they can be omitted, so "00FF00" will be considered the same as "FF00".  As an example, the color fuchsia can be defined with a red intensity of 255 (FF in hexadecimal), a green intensity of 0 (00 in hexadecimal) and a blue intensity of 255 (FF in hexadecimal).  To have EOF render the peak amplitudes of the waveform graph in fushsia, edit the value of the "eof_color_waveform_peak" entry in song.ini to "eof_color_waveform_peak = FF00FF".  The trough (minimum) and RMS amplitudes can have custom colors defined the same way.  There are various hex color charts and calculators available on the Internet that may help you find interesting colors, such as <a href="http://welcowebdesign.com/color.html">http://welcowebdesign.com/color.html</a>.  To reset to the default waveform graph colors, just delete the waveform color definitions under the [colors] section of eof.cfg and save the file.  Do note that you must save your changes after EOF is closed, because the program will rewrite the current colors when it exits, and this would otherwise overwrite your changes.<br>
<h1><a name="catalog">Catalog</a></h1>
Perform various catalog related operations. The catalog contains portions of your song which you can play back or paste into other parts of the song (see "<a href=functions.htm#pastefrom">Edit>Paste From</a>"). "Show" toggles the catalog display. "Add" adds the currently selected notes to the catalog. "Delete" deletes the current catalog entry. "Previous" selects the previous catalog entry. "Next" selects the next catalog entry. See the <a href=edit.htm#catalog>Catalog section of Editing Songs</a> for more details.<br>
<h1><a name="inisettings">INI Settings</a></h1>
Define additional INI settings which are not available in <a href="functions.htm#properties">Song Properties</a>.<br>
<h1><a name="properties">Properties</a></h1>
Change the song properties for the current project.<br>
<blockquote>
"Song Title" is the name of the song.<br><br>
"Artist" is the artist the song is attributed to.<br><br>
"Frettist" refers to the person who created the "Frets On Fire" note charts.<br><br>
"Delay" is the delay or MIDI offset value which tells "Frets On Fire" how much time to delay the notes. Changing the "Delay" setting alters the position of all the beat lines in the current project and optionally adjusts the note positions as well.<br><br>
"Year" refers to the year the song was released.<br><br>
"Diff" refers to the band difficulty (tier) of the song as a whole.<br><br>
"Lyrics" refers to the optional song.ini parameter that indicates to FoFiX that it should display Script style lyrics during chart playback using the file script.txt.  If this checkbox is checked, and your chart has lyrics defined, EOF will create the script.txt lyric file automatically during a save operation and enable it in the chart's song.ini file.  This will provide subtitle style lyrics for various versions of Frets on Fire, even those that did not support scrolling lyrics.<br><br>
"8th Note HO/PO" refers to the optional song.ini parameter that overrides FoF's default Hammer On/Pull Off settings, specifying that a single note (probably not chords, but this may vary between versions of FoF) in any guitar track that is 1/8 of one measure apart or closer to the previous note will be a HOPO note and not require a strum.  This song.ini parameter should work in RF-Mod based versions of FoF, such as RF-Mod, Alarian and FoFiX.<br><br>
"Use fret hand pos of 1 (pro g)" refers to an advanced feature relating to authoring custom pro guitar content for Rock Band.  When this option is enabled, EOF will export the MIDI so that a single fret hand position of fret 1 is written for the 17 and 22 fret pro guitar tracks, instead of writing a fret hand position for each note in the expert difficulty of each of the two tracks.  This allows dislike guitar parts to be authored in different difficulties of the same guitar track, which would otherwise have fret hand markers written based on the notes in the expert difficulty, but if the fret numbers used get too high, it can lead to RB3 displaying incorrect fret numbers for those gems.<br><br>
"Use fret hand pos of 1 (pro b)" refers to an advanced feature relating to authoring custom pro guitar content for Rock Band.  When this option is enabled, EOF will export the MIDI so that a single fret hand position of fret 1 is written for the 17 and 22 fret pro bass tracks, instead of writing a fret hand position for each note in the expert difficulty of each of the two tracks.<br><br>
"Loading Text" is the text that appears on the loading screen while your song is loading in "Frets On Fire" (currently only supported in FoFiX).<br>
</blockquote>
EOF stores all these settings in the ".eof" project file and exports relevant options to "song.ini" when saving for compatibility with "Frets On Fire."<br>
<h1><a name="difficulty">Set track difficulty</a></h1>
Allows the difficulty raiting (AKA tier) of the active track to be set.  Doing so when PART DRUMS is active will also allow you to define the pro drum difficulty since it does not have a separate track. Doing so when PART VOCALS is active will also allow you to define the harmony vocal difficulty, since harmonies will eventually be charted as separate "difficulties" (tabs) of the one vocal track. You can set the band difficulty tier in <a href="functions.htm#properties">Song>Properties</a>.<br>
<h1><a name="silence">Leading Silence</a></h1>
Allows you to insert silent audio at the beginning of the chart audio, for purposes of allowing enough time before the first beat marker or simply give the chart a polished look by easily adding a controlled amount of leading silence before the first beat marker without having to alter the audio in another program such as Audacity.  Unless necessary for syncing purposes, it's best to sync the first beat marker for your chart (see the <a href="../tutorial/index.htm">EOF Tutorial</a> for details) before using this feature.  When you access the Leading Silence feature, you have the option of adding a specified number of milliseconds' or beat's (based on the first beat's tempo) worth of silence (only positive, whole numbers) to beginning of the chart via two different options:  The first option (Add) simply adds the specified amount of silence whereas the second option (Pad) will take the first beat marker's position (MIDI delay) into account to adjust the chart so that the amount of silence added moves the first beat marker to the specified position from the start of the audio.  The appropriate amount of silent audio is created and the currently loaded OGG file is joined to it.  For example:  If you have synced a chart to have a MIDI delay of 225, adding 100ms of silence will result in the chart having a MIDI delay of 335 afterward.  If you pad to 500ms of silence instead, it will result in the chart having a MIDI delay of 500ms afterward.<br><br>
EOF takes precautions to preserve the original audio, making this function safe to use.  When this feature is used to add silence to the beginning of a chart, the original audio for the currently loaded OGG file (see <a href="functions.htm#loadogg">Load OGG</a> for details) is saved with a ".backup" file extension, allowing you to restore the original audio file manually if necessary.  The undo and redo features are also compatible with this function, so you can simply undo and redo the adding of leading silence as desired.  If you have already made enough changes so that there are not enough undo states to revert the addition of leading silence, you can open the leading silence feature again and add 0 ms of silence, and the original audio will be restored.  That will also work for restoring the original audio file even if EOF crashed before saving changes.  After each change to the audio, including the addition of, undoing of or redoing of leading silence, the waveform graph will be recreated if it has been generated.  In the Leading Silence dialog menu, you have the option of whether or not to adjust the position of the note and beat markers.  You should allow them to be adjusted if you are using this feature on a chart that is already synced and has notes.  There are also two methods presented for processing the audio:<br><br>
<u>Stream Copy</u>:  This method uses a third party utility called "oggCat" to append the original audio to the silent audio by streaming the two audio files together, preventing the audio quality loss that would occur by having to re-encode the audio.  This means that to use the feature, you will need to have oggCat (part of the <a href="http://dev.streamnik.de/oggvideotools.html">OGG Video Tools</a>) on your system (callable from any directory, such as in your PATH environment variable, or in EOF's program file folder).  OggCat binaries are available for Windows on the OGG Video Tools website, but Mac and Linux users will need to build the OGG Video Tools in order to use the feature.  There are some limitations to oggCat, so it is possible that afterward the audio may sound corrupted.  If that happens, just undo the operation and retry adding leading silence with the "Re-encode" option detailed below.  In most cases, oggCat will work as desired and will finish more quickly without any quality loss since re-encoding is avoided.  You may notice that a slightly different amount of silence than you specified may be the result, due to technical limitations of how OGG files work.  This should not prevent the chart from remaining synced though, as EOF appropriately adjusts the first beat marker.<br><br>
<u>Re-encode</u>:  This method decodes the currently loaded OGG file and re-encodes it with the leading silence.  This method takes longer, but would be as accurate as possible with no slight difference in leading audio that could occur with using oggCat.  This is also the only alternative if the OGG file you are using is incompatible with oggCat in that it resulted in corrupted audio.  If you originally selected to use an MP3 file when you created your chart (in EOF 1.7 or later, see <a href="functions.htm#new">File>New</a>), the MP3 file is copied to the chart's project folder and re-used with this re-encode operation.  This means that if you created the chart with an MP3, using the re-encode leading silence feature will not lower the audio quality of your chart, since the same MP3 file is decoded and encoded to OGG just the same as when the chart audio was originally created.  If you created your chart in an older version of EOF or by providing an OGG file in the New Chart wizard, the loaded OGG file is decoded and re-encoded, which will result in some quality loss.  If you did create your chart with an MP3 file in a version of EOF before 1.7, and still have the original MP3 file, you can copy it to your chart's project folder and rename it to "original.mp3" (do note that Linux is case sensitive, and Mac may be, so use lowercase letters in the name).<br><br>
If you have added leading silence and haven't saved, if you discard changes when exiting EOF, loading another chart or importing a MIDI or Feedback chart, EOF will restore the OGG files that were in use during the last save operation.  This will prevent the chart from being left synced to the wrong OGG file.<br>
<h1><a name="openbass">Enable open strum bass</a></h1>
Enables or disables the option to chart open strum bass guitar notes, which require a strum with NO frets held in-game.  The method to chart these notes is offered in EOF as a sixth lane in PART BASS, which can be used similarly to the other 5 lanes, using the <u>6</u> number key and/or the right mouse button or Insert key.  Due to what open strum bass notes represent, they may not be used in a chord or overlap with another note, because that would make it cease to be an open note.  For this reason, open strum bass notes are not allowed to be marked with the "crazy" note status.  Open strum bass notes always require a strum, so they cannot be assigned a HOPO status.  If open strum bass notes are enabled during a save operation, a "sysex_open_bass = True" tag is written to the song.ini file for the chart to indicate that Sysex open bass phrase markers are present.  Frets on Fire and FoFiX do not currently support open strum bass notes, but Phase Shift does.<br><br>
If a chart has open bass notes and you disable the open strum bass note feature, the notes in lane 6 are hidden from view in the piano roll and 3D preview window but are not deleted.  When open strum bass is disabled, if you place any gem on lanes 1 through 5 at the position of a hidden open bass note and then open strum  bass is enabled again, those gems are removed to satisfy the requirement that open bass does not overlap with any notes.  During note toggle and transpose operations, lanes will be emptied and HOPO/crazy statuses removed appropriately if lane 6 is populated in PART BASS by the operation.<br><br>
<a href="functions.htm#sysexwarning">Be aware that this feature is marked in the MIDI using Sysex, which FoF and FoFiX will have compatibility issues with.</a><br>
<h1><a name="fivelanedrum">Enable five lane drums</a></h1>
Enables or disables the option to chart with an additional drum lane, for a total of five lanes and a bass pedal, similar to drum charts in Guitar Hero World Tour.  Five lane drums is a feature that is supported in Phase Shift, but it is not supported by Frets on Fire or FoFiX.  If you have authored any gems (displayed in purple) on this extra drum lane, "Enable five lane drums" must be enabled when you save the chart, otherwise they will not be added to the MIDI file that is created.  Disabling the feature will not remove any purple gems you may have already added, it will just not display them.  If this option is enabled during save, a "five_lane_drums = True" INI tag will be written.  This tag forces the chart to be treated as a 5 lane drum track (ie. Guitar Hero) even if there are no gems on the fifth lane, for use in future versions of Phase Shift.  It will also signal for Phase Shift to display the lanes in the same order as they are presented in EOF.  If this tag was omitted for a MIDI that included a five lane drum track, the two right-most lanes are swapped as part of a backwards compatibility mechanism present in the game.<br>
<h1><a name="songproguitar">Pro Guitar</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<b><u>Set track tuning:</u></b>  Allows you to set the tuning for each string. By default, guitar/bass tunings are in standard tuning and you define how many half steps each string is tuned up (positive number) or down (negative number). When entering a string's tuning, the name of the note the string would sound when played open (no frets held) is listed on the side to help you keep track. If you enter a tuning that EOF recognizes, it will display the tuning name (ie. "Drop D tuning"). In order for chord detection to work properly, you must set the correct tuning and number of strings for the pro guitar/bass tracks that are authored.<br><br>
<b><u>Set number of frets/strings:</u></b>  Allows you to set the number of strings and frets for the active pro guitar or pro bass track.  By default, PART_REAL_GUITAR and PART_REAL_BASS each use 17 frets and PART_REAL_GUITAR_22 and PART_REAL_BASS_22 use 22 frets each as in Rock Band 3.  By default, pro guitar tracks use 6 strings and pro bass tracks use 4 strings.<br><br>
<b><u>Enable legacy view:</u></b>  Assists with down-charting a pro guitar track to a legacy (5 lane) track by showing the entire pro guitar track as it would paste into a legacy track, allowing you to fine tune the legacy values for each note easily. When Legacy View is active, you can use the standard method for editing regular guitar notes and it will act like a normal 5 lane instrument track. If you change a note in this mode, it won't automatically change all other identical pro guitar notes' legacy values in the track difficulty, but you can open the edit pro guitar note dialog menu for the desired note and just press OK to have EOF apply the changed legacy values to the appropriate notes. You can even create new notes in legacy view, and the new note will be created with default fret values of 0 for applicable lanes. If you haven't manually set the legacy value checkboxes for any notes, those notes will render with a maroon background color in the piano roll to alert you. This way you won't be able to accidentally miss any notes when you work on down-charting a pro guitar chart.<br><br>
<b><u>Previous chord name:</u></b><br>
<b><u>Next chord name:</u></b>  When a note that matches multiple chord names is selected, the bottom of the information panel will indicate there are multiple chord matches.  You can use these functions to view the other names the selected chord may go by.  While the note remains selected, the selected alternate chord name will be displayed in the editor and 3D preview windows.

<h1><a name="rawmidi">Manage raw MIDI tracks</a></h1>
Allows management of MIDI tracks that have been imported and stored into the EOF project (ie. if prompted during MIDI import).  The tracks listed here will be saved in the project, and written to MIDI files saved by EOF (except for notes_pro.mid, since the only tracks that MIDI should include are the pro guitar/bass tracks).  The add button will allow you to browse for a MIDI or RBA file and select a track to store into the project, to be written to the MIDI file created by EOF during save operations.  If you select to store a track with the same name as a track EOF is already storing in the current project, you will be prompted to either cancel or replace the existing stored track.  If a song.ini file exists in the same directory as the selected MIDI/RBA file, EOF will prompt whether or not to apply the MIDI delay specified in the INI file, and it will be used to offset the timing for each event in the track as it is stored to the project.  A negative MIDI delay is allowed during this process, but only if the delay would not cause any events to have a negative timing.  Some tracks are not allowed to be imported (track 0, "BEAT" or "EVENTS"), as they are create by EOF during save.
<h1><a name="testinfof">Test In FOF</a></h1>
Launch FOF with the current song, track, and difficulty for testing. This feature only works if you are using an RF-based mod (ie. Alarian Mod or FoFiX) and have correctly linked EOF to it (see <a href="functions.htm#linktofof">File>Link to FOF</a>).  As of this release, it has been confirmed through testing and documentation that "Test in FoF" should work for Frets on Fire releases from MFH Alarian Mod 2.900 through FoFiX 3.100.<br>
<h1><a name="testinps">Test In Phase Shift</a></h1>
Launch Phase Shift with the current song in practice mode, allowing you to adjust the playback speed of the chart in 5% increments during play.  Phase Shift will allow you to select which instrument and which difficulty to play.  This feature only works if you using a supported version of Phase Shift (0.75g or later) and have correctly linked EOF to it (see <a href="functions.htm#linktops">File>Link to Phase Shift</a>).<br>

<blockquote>
<h1><a name="toggle">Toggle</a></h1>
Toggle the desired gem color on/off in all selected notes.<br>
<h1><a name="clear">Clear</a></h1>
Clear the desired gem color for all selected notes.  Combining this with the toggle function makes it easy to have a specific gem color toggled, set or cleared for all selected notes.<br>
<h1><a name="transposeup">Transpose Up</a></h1>
Transpose (move) all selected notes up one color. If any of the selected notes have a gem in the highest lane, the transpose will be prevented.<br>
<h1><a name="transposedown">Transpose Down</a></h1>
Transpose (move) all selected notes down one color. If any of the selected notes have a gem in lane 1, the transpose will be prevented.<br>
<h1><a name="resnap">Resnap</a></h1>
Resnap all selected notes to the closest grid snap positions according to the current grid snap setting (see "<a href="functions.htm#gridsnap">Edit>Grid Snap</a>"). If two notes snap to the same position you will be notified so that you can undo if you want. It is best to use either 1/32 or 1/48 grid snap when resnapping.<br><br>
Let's say you imported a song and some of the notes appear to be slightly off of the beat markers. Setting the grid snap to 1/32, selecting all the notes, and doing a "Resnap" can set the notes in their proper place without you having to manually move each note.<br>
<h1><a name="solos">Solos</a></h1>
Perform various operations related to solo sections. "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a solo section. "Remove" removes all solos in which selected notes lie. To delete one solo section simply select at least one note within that solo and select Note>Solos>Remove.  "Erase All" erases all solo sections from the current track. "Re-Mark" will modify an existing solo section. If you mark a solo and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the solo and select Note>Solos>Re-Mark.  "Re-Mark" is only available when at least one of the selected notes lies within a solo section.<br><br>
Solo sections are not supported by all mods. For FoFiX (the only mod with solo support as of this writing) solo sections will only work correctly if you define at least two Star Power sections (see "<a href="functions.htm#starpower">Note>Star Power</a>") as well. This is due to the way FoFiX detects solo sections. Guitar Hero and Rock Band use different conventions to define Star Power (Overdrive in RB) and Guitar Hero's SP markers happen to use the same MIDI note as Rock Band's solos. If you don't define Star Power, FoFiX will detect your solos as Star Power except under certain circumstances.<br><br>
If you want your solo sections to be compatible with older mods (such as MFH) you can use the older Text Events method of marking solos documented <a href="edit.htm#events">here</a>.<br><br>
It's important to note that solos are not automatically treated as sections by FoFiX so you will need to add Text Events (see <a href="edit.htm#events">the Events section of Editing Songs</a>) in the appropriate places if you want to have your solos listed in Practice mode.<br><br>
"Copy From" allows all solo sections from one track to be copied into the current track.  This is convenient when up-charting a 5 lane guitar track to pro guitar or vice versa, because they should have identical solo sections.<br>
<h1><a name="starpower">Star Power</a></h1>
Perform various operations related to Star Power sections. "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a Star Power section. "Remove" removes all Star Power sections in which selected notes lie. To delete one Star Power section simply select at least one note within that section and select Note>Star Power>Remove.  "Erase All" erases all Star Power sections from the song. "Re-Mark" will modify an existing Star Power section. If you mark a Star Power section and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the section and select Note>Star Power>Re-Mark.  "Re-Mark" is only available when at least on of the selected notes lies within the Star Power section.<br><br>
Star Power sections are not supported by all FoF mods. Currently (at the time of this writing) the only version of Frets on Fire that allows user-defined Star Power sections is FoFiX.<br><br>
"Copy From" allows all solo sections from one track to be copied into the current track.  This is convenient when up-charting a 5 lane guitar track to pro guitar or vice versa, because they should have identical solo sections.  This is also useful if you want to create a chart with lots of unison star power sections (Rock Band 3).<br>
<h1><a name="delete">Delete</a></h1>
Deletes all selected notes.<br>
<h1><a name="editname">Edit Name</a></h1>
Allows a name to be provided for the selected notes.  For notes except those in pro guitar, these are stored internally only and not saved to MIDI.  For pro guitar tracks, notes that are manually named will override the name that is determined by the chord detection system, affecting how the chords will be displayed in Phase Shift and Rock Band 3.  If you intentionally want a chord to display with no name, you can provide a name of white space (ie. one spacebar press).<br>
<h1><a name="crazy">Toggle Crazy</a></h1>
Allows the selected notes to overlap other notes, overriding EOF's default behavior of truncating note tails to prevent this.  Use this feature to create "extended sustain" notes, where the notes in a sustained chord are played separately but are all held for the duration of the chord.<br>
<h1><a name="hopo">HOPO</a></h1>
Set the HOPO status of selected notes.  Currently, FoFiX only makes a note a HOPO (Hammer On/Pull Off, meaning that a note does not have to be strummed) if it is close enough to the previous note.  What amounts to "close enough" depends on the tempo, the presence of the eighthnote_hopo option in the chart's song.ini file and the user's in-game HOPO settings.  Eventually, FoFiX may be updated to support notation where a note is manually defined as having HOPO forced on or off, as Rock Band charts have this feature.  You can force HOPO status to prepare your chart to have this functionality for future versions of FoFiX, or for other rhythm games that may support this already (such as Phase Shift, which does support forced on/off HOPO notation).  A note that has HOPO forced on will be drawn smaller than normal in the piano roll area, and a note with HOPO forced off will be drawn larger than normal.  You can also use the H key to cycle the HOPO status for the currently selected notes (between HOPO On, HOPO Off and Auto).<br><br>
If the active track is a pro guitar track, the contents of this menu are changed to allow you to set notes as being specifically hammer on or pull off.<br>
<h1><a name="trill">Trill</a></h1>
Perform various operations related to trill sections.  "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a trill section.  "Remove" removes all trill sections in which selected notes lie.  To delete one trill section simply select at least one note within that section and select "Note>Trill>Remove".  "Erase All" erases all trill sections from the current track.  "Re-Mark" will modify an existing trill section.  If you mark a trill and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the section and select Note>Trill>Re-Mark.  "Re-Mark" is only available when at least one of the selected notes lies within a trill section.<br><br>Trill sections were introduced in Rock Band 3, and generally a set of notes that alternate between two different values (ie. for legacy guitar: Green, red, green, red, or for pro guitar: Fret 15, 17, 15, 17, etc.), and should generally be similar to HOPOs in a legacy guitar track. In a pro guitar track, the pull off must be timed correctly so that you pull off when the lower fretted note is to be be played (the oppose of a hammer on). In PART DRUMS, trill sections are known as "special drum rolls", basically drum rolls that use multiple lanes, such as cymbal swells.  EOF renders the background of the lanes used in trill sections with that lane's color to make it easy to identify where these sections exist.  Since they look similar to tremolo sections, EOF will add "tr" notation at the bottom of the editor window for each trill section, and will add "~" notation for each note within the sections.  Trill sections are currently only supported in Rock Band 3.<br><br>
"Copy From" allows all trill sections from one track to be copied into the current track. This is convenient when up-charting a 5 lane guitar track to pro guitar or vice versa, or creating an additional 17 or 22 fret version of the track, because they should have identical trill sections.<br>
<h1><a name="tremolo">Tremolo</a></h1>
Perform various operations related to tremolo sections.  "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a tremolo section.  "Remove" removes all tremolo sections in which selected notes lie.  To delete one tremolo section simply select at least one note within that section and select "Note>Tremolo>Remove".  "Erase All" erases all tremolo sections from the current track.  "Re-Mark" will modify an existing tremolo section.  If you mark a tremolo and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the section and select Note>Tremolo>Re-Mark.  "Re-Mark" is only available when at least one of the selected notes lies within a tremolo section.<br><br>Tremolo sections were introduced in Rock Band 3, and generally are just a set of identical notes (using the same fret) that are played very quickly.  Theoretically (in-game), you can pick as quickly or slowly as you want without losing streak as long as the notes specifically authored in the phrase are hit.  In PART DRUMS, tremolo sections are known as "drum rolls".  EOF renders the background of the lanes used in trill sections with that lane's color to make it easy to identify where these sections exist.  Since they look similar to trill sections, EOF will add "TP" notation at the bottom of the editor window for each tremolo section, and will add "-" notation for each note within the sections.

<h1><a name="slider">Slider</a></h1>
Perform various operations related to slider sections.  "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a slider section.  "Remove" removes all slider sections in which selected notes lie.  To delete one slider section simply select at least one note within that section and select "Note>Slider>Remove".  "Erase All" erases all slider sections from the current track.  "Re-Mark" will modify an existing slider section.  If you mark a slider and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the section and select Note>Slider>Re-Mark.  "Re-Mark" is only available when at least one of the selected notes lies within a slider section.  EOF renders a purple rectangle above the piano roll where these sections exist to make it easy to identify them.  In addition, the 3D preview will draw a purple line between slider notes, similarly to how they would appear in Guitar Hero World Tour.<br><br>Slider notes are special type of note introduced in Guitar Hero World Tour that allow notes to be played without strumming, using a touch sensitive strip on the guitar released for the game, also allowing various effects such as whammying and sliding.  EOF currently only allows slider sections to be authored in 5 lane guitar tracks.  If any slider sections exist during save, a "sysex_slider = True" song.ini tag is written.  Frets on Fire and FoFiX do not currently support slider sections, but Phase Shift does.<br><br>
<a href="functions.htm#sysexwarning">Be aware that this feature is marked in the MIDI using Sysex, which FoF and FoFiX will have compatibility issues with.</a><br>
<h1><a name="thindiff">Thin difficulty to match</a></h1>
Thins notes in the current track difficulty by comparing them with another track.  When the function is used, EOF checks each note in the active track difficulty against the notes in the active difficulty of the specified track.  If a note in the active track is not close enough to a note in the specified track (within 2 ms), it is removed.  This function makes it easier to thin the number of notes in the lower difficulties of a pro guitar track to be similar to the note thinning that was done for lower difficulties of a five lane instrument track or vice versa.<br>
<h1><a name="drum">Drum</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<b><u>Cymbal notation:</u></b>  Allows yellow, blue or green drum gems to be marked/unmarked as cymbals.  This notation is in the style of Rock Band 1's and 2's unused pro drum notation and Rock Band 3's Pro Drum mode, differentiating which notes require hitting a drum instead of the cymbal of the same color.  Rock Band 3's drum kit has 4 pads (red, yellow, blue and green), a bass drum pedal and 3 cymbals (yellow, blue and green).  By default, EOF will render drum gems with the same colors as they appear in Rock Band, but EOF's original color set displayed green drum notes as being purple, in order to differentiate them from bass drum, which were drawn in the color green in EOF.<br><br>
A pro drum phrase applies to all drum notes in the track contained between the start and end of the phrase, regardless of which difficulty the drum notes are in, similar to overdrive and solo sections.  At the moment, for practicality reasons, EOF is not implementing this notation in the editor as phrases.  However, when notes are added or moved to a location where a cymbal note exists (in any drum difficulty), those notes are marked as cymbals where appropriate.  You will be able to tell which notes are marked as cymbals as they will be drawn as triangles in the piano roll editor and as cones in the 3D preview window.  During save, the MIDI is created to have the appropriate pro drum phrase markers for the drum notes in all difficulties.<br><br>
For EOF to create a MIDI having pro drum notation, at least one normal Green/Yellow/Blue drum note must be marked as a cymbal and at least one must not be marked as a cymbal (which denotes it as a tom drum note).  If there is not at least one tom and one cymbal note in the chart, the drum notes will be saved to MIDI in the original style, with no pro drum phrases.  Even if this occurs, EOF writes a song.ini tag (pro_drums = True) so the game playing the chart knows to display cymbals even through no tom markers are in the MIDI file.  EOF will check for the presence of this INI tag and will correctly import a cymbals-only drum chart MIDI if the tag is present.  If at least one cymbal and one tom are charted, the drum notes will be saved with pro notation:  Green, yellow and blue drum notes that are outside their respective pro drum phrases are treated as cymbals.  They are shown as tom drums instead of cymbals if they are in the appropriate phrases.  Frets on Fire does not currently support pro drum charts, but it should still allow them to be played as 5 note drum charts.  Phase Shift has support for pro drum charts, requiring the player to hit cymbals instead of drums where appropriate.<br><br>
Commonly, a chart will have more involvement with cymbals than it will with tom drums.  For example, the hi-hat is properly charted as a cymbal (traditionally the yellow cymbal), and in all likelihood will be used more often than any tom drum charted on that color.  With this in mind, you can use the "<u>Mark new notes as cymbals</u>" option to allow you to chart several cymbal notes in a row without having to manually highlight and mark notes as cymbals.  When this feature is activated (it will show as checked in the "Pro drum mode notation" menu), all yellow, blue or green (previously displayed in EOF as purple) drum notes that are toggled on or created will be automatically marked as cymbals.  Drum notes in other difficulties that are at the position of the toggled/created cymbal notes are also marked as cymbals.  This remains in effect until the feature is de-activated.  This feature does not apply to pasted notes.<br><br>
The "<u>Mark as non cymbal</u>" function removes cymbal notation from all selected drum notes and drum notes at equivalent positions in other difficulties.  If you wanted to select a range of notes and ensure that toggling cymbal notation turned on cymbal notation for those notes, clearing cymbal notation and then toggling on would be a guaranteed way of achieving this without having to make sure none of the selected notes were already marked as cymbals.<br><br>
<b><u>Expert+ notation:</u></b>  Enables or disables the selected bass drum notes (lane 1 drum gems) from being associated with the Expert+ drum difficulty.  This difficulty is similar in theory to Expert, but it includes faster use of the bass drum pedal in what people usually refer to as "double bass".  Besides the specially marked "double bass" notes, all other notes in the Expert+ difficulty will be the same as those in the Expert difficulty.  Only bass drum notes in the Expert difficulty can be marked this way, which will cause the affected notes to show with a red center in the piano roll and entirely red in the 3D preview.  When the chart is saved and the MIDI file is created, affected notes will be written to exist in the Expert+ difficulty instead of Expert (written as MIDI note 95).  Phase Shift version 0.71 implemented this notation, allowing people to create a chart so that the game will offer the "Expert+" drum difficulty if there are any gems using note 95.  Since there are no immediate plans for FoFiX to support this feature, if the chart being saved has any bass drum notes marked for Expert+, EOF will automatically create an "expert+.mid" file in addition to "notes.mid" during save.  This "expert+.mid" file will contain only the Expert+ difficulty, which is composed of all notes from the Expert difficulty and the Expert+ bass drum notes.  Until FoFiX implements MIDI note 95 for Expert+ bass drum, people will be able to rename the "expert+.mid" file to "notes.mid" or "notes-unedited.mid" in order to play the Expert+ drum difficulty in FoFiX.<br><br>
Similarly to with cymbals, you can use the "<u>Mark new notes as Expert+</u>" option to have new bass drum notes places in the Amazing difficulty to automatically be marked as double bass.  This should make it more convenient to upgrade an Expert drum chart to Expert+.<br><br>
<b><u>Hi hat and rim shot notation:</u></b>  Allows yellow drum notes to be marked as either open hi hat, foot pedal controlled hi hat, sizzle (half open) hi hat, or red drum notes to be marked as rim shots.  If any hi hat marking exists during save, a "sysex_high_hat_ctrl = True" song.ini tag is written.  Similarly to with cymbals, you can use the options in the "<u>Mark new Y notes as</u>" menu to have new yellow drum gems automatically converted to open, pedal or sizzle hi hat status.  If the <a href="configure.htm#preferences">"Drum modifiers affect all diff's"</a> preference is enabled, any hi hat or rim shot status applied to new or existing notes will apply to notes at the same positions in other difficulties.  If any rim shot marking exists during save, a "sysex_rimshot = True" song.ini tag is written.  These drum notations are a unique feature of Phase Shift, and will not work in FoF, FoFiX or Rock Band.<br><br>
<a href="functions.htm#sysexwarning">Be aware that hi hat and rim shot notation is marked in the MIDI using Sysex, which FoF and FoFiX will have compatibility issues with.</a>

<h1><a name="noteproguitar">Pro Guitar</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<b><u>Edit pro guitar note:</b></u>  Allows various properties to be changed for selected pro guitar notes.  The field immediately next to each string defines the fret that is being held for the string.  If the string is not being played, leave the field blank.  If the string is played open (no frets held), enter a 0 into the field.  If the string is played muted (fret held weakly so that the string does not ring out when played), enter an X into the field or select the "Mute" checkbox to the right of the string's fret number field.  As per Rock Band 3's notation, a muted string can have a fret value specified, and this may be useful to help control the direction of muted slide notes without using a ghost note at the end of the slide.  If no fret value is specified, or the fret number field contains the letter X, the note will export to MIDI as if the string was not fretted (fret 0) but was muted.  Next to each string is a "Ghost" checkbox, which us used when authoring notes within an arpeggio section (detailed below).  When OK is clicked to close the edit pro guitar note window, EOF will update the selected note(s) and offer to apply the updated information to other identical (same used pro guitar lanes and same used fret values) pro guitar notes in the track. If the name field was left empty, it will search for names already applied to other identical notes in the track and offer to fill in the name for you. If the name field is not empty, EOF will offer to apply the name to all identical notes in the track. If all 5 legacy value checkboxes are unchecked, EOF will offer search for other identical notes in the track difficulty and offer to fill in the legacy values for you. If at least 1 of the legacy value checkboxes are checked, EOF will offer to apply the legacy value checkboxes to all identical notes in the track difficulty. This should help minimize the amount of duplicated work needed to chart a pro guitar track and an accompanying expert legacy guitar track.<br><br>There are 5 "Legacy" checkboxes, representing how the pro guitar note will behave when pasted into a 5 lane instrument track.  For example, if the lane 1 and 3 legacy checkboxes are checked for a pro guitar note, if that note is copied to EOF's clipboard and pasted into PART_GUITAR, it will paste as a Green+Yellow chord.  This is especially useful for ensuring that all instances of a chord paste the same way into a 5 lane guitar track when down-charting a pro guitar chart.  For example, when you have completed authoring the pro guitar track, you can select a C chord and edit the legacy settings for the note.  When you click OK to close the Edit pro guitar note menu, EOF will offer to update all identical C chords with the same legacy settings.  A helpful way to maintain consistency when down-charting will be to configure the legacy settings for all chords in the expert difficulty (Using the <a href="functions.htm#songproguitar">"Enable legacy view"</a> feature will make this process easier) and then pasting the pro guitar notes all at once into the expert difficulty of a 5 lane track.  Afterward, manually adjust the frets as desired to improve the flow between chords and single notes, and then chart lower difficulties for that 5 lane track like normal.<br><br>Many other Rock Band 3 pro guitar mechanics can be set in this dialog menu, but the "Tap" and "Palm mute" options are currently just for decoration only and have no effect in Rock Band 3.<br><br>Do note that you can only add gems to strings that are enabled for the track.  <a href="functions.htm#songproguitar">Set number of frets/strings</a> allows the number of strings for a pro guitar or pro bass track to be set to 4, 5 or 6.  Also note that you cannot use a fret number higher than a track's current limit, which can be viewed or changed with <a href="functions.htm#songproguitar">Set track tuning</a>.  In order for EOF's chord detection system to work properly, you must set the correct tuning for the pro guitar/bass tracks.<br><br>
<b><u>Toggle slide up:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Toggle slide down:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove slide:</b></u>  Allows you to specify whether a note slides up or down, where the player must slide the fret hand up or down the fretboard while keeping the played strings held down.  Custom Sysex notation is also  used to allow Phase Shift to play pro guitar slide sections.<br><br>
<a name="sysexwarning"><b><font color="red">Caution</font></b></a>:  Do note, however, that it has been found that a bug in all versions of Frets on Fire and FoFiX (up to the latest release:  FoFiX 4.0 alpha 2) prevent them from working correctly with MIDI files that use Sysex.  In such an event where you want to make a full featured chart for use in Phase Shift and also have a MIDI usable in FoF/FoFiX, you can enable the <a href="configure.htm#separatemidis">"Save separate RBN MIDI files" preference</a> and use the notes_rbn.mid file (which you will need to rename to notes.mid) for FoF/FoFiX.<br><br>
<b><u>Arpeggio:</b></u>
<blockquote>
<b><u>Mark:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Erase All:</b></u>  Perform various operations related to arpeggio sections. "Mark" marks the currently selected notes as a arpeggio section. "Remove" removes all arpeggio sections in which selected notes lie. To delete one arpeggio section simply select at least one note within that section and select "Note>Pro Guitar>Arpeggio>Remove.  "Erase All" erases all arpeggio sections from the song. "Re-Mark" will modify an existing arpeggio section. If you mark a arpeggio section and later need to modify it, simply select the notes that belong in the section and select "Note>Pro Guitar>Arpeggio>Re-Mark." "Re-Mark" is only available when at least on of the selected notes lies within the arpeggio section.<br><br>Arpeggio sections allow the authoring of "broken chords", where instead of playing all notes at once, they are played in a spread out fashion, often sequentially by string order.  The correct way to author these so that they work in Rock Band 3 is to place pro guitar notes normally at the start of the arpeggio section.  Then for notes further into the arpeggio, mark them as "ghost" notes by editing each with the "Edit pro guitar note" menu (ie. select the note and press the N key).  The note for each string can be marked as a ghosted note by enabling the ghost check box next to the string's input field.  If you use chords within an arpeggio phrase, you may want to ensure those chords don't display in-game with chord names by adding whitespace to their names.<br><br>
<b><u>Copy From:</b></u>  Allows all arpeggio sections from one track to be copied into the current track.  This is convenient when authoring both a 17 and a 22 fret version of a pro guitar or pro bass track so that you don't have to manually place them a second time.<br>
</blockquote>
<b><u>Clear legacy bitmask:</b></u>  Clears the legacy settings for all selected notes.<br><br>
<b><u>Toggle Strum Up:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Toggle Strum Mid:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Toggle Strum Down:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove strum direction:</b></u>  Allows the strum's focus area to be specified as Up (U), Mid (M) or Down (D).  Rock Band 3 allows these notations to indicate which strings are checked in order to decide whether a note is hit or missed, relaxing the scoring system and otherwise guiding the player's strumming style during fast strumming sections, having a net effect of indicating which strums are upward/downward.  Upward strum markers cause the G, B, and E strings to be checked.  Mid strum markers cause the A, D, G, and B strings to be checked.  Downward strum makers cause the low E, A, and D strings to be checked.<br><br>
<b><u>Toggle tapping:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove tapping:</b></u>  Allows you to chart notes that are tapped.  Although Rock Band 3 doesn't display these in-game, Harmonix charts them on channel 4 (instead of channel 0 like regular notes).<br><br>
<b><u>Toggle bend:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove bend:</b></u>  Allows you to chart notes that are bent.  Although Rock Band 3 doesn't display these in-game, Harmonix charts them on channel 2 (instead of channel 0 like regular notes).<br><br>
<b><u>Toggle palm muting:</b></u><br>
<b><u>Remove palm muting:</b></u>  Allows you to indicate notes that are played palm muted, where the guitarist rests the palm of his strumming hand on the guitar strings to muffle them, causing them to not ring out as long as they normally would.  Custom Sysex notation is used to notate this playing style.  Phase Shift may eventually add support for this feature.<br>
<a href="functions.htm#sysexwarning">Be aware that this feature is marked in the MIDI using Sysex, which FoF and FoFiX will have compatibility issues with.</a><br><br>
<b><u>Toggle harmonic:</b></u><br>

<blockquote>
<h1><a name="bpmchange">BPM Change</a></h1>
Change the BPM of the currently selected beat. If "This Beat Only" is selected, only the current beat will be set to the new BPM. Further beats will remain at the old BPM setting. "Adjust Notes" causes any notes within beats affected by the BPM change to be scaled to fit (the same as the "<a href="functions.htm#preferences">"Note Auto-Adjust"</a> option when moving beat markers with the mouse).<br>
<h1><a name="timesignature">Time Signature</a></h1>
Set the time signature starting from the currently selected beat. You may use any of the preset time signatures or provide a custom time signature. If you provide a custom signature, the denominator (beat unit) must be a power of two (ie. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256). The use of a denominator that is not a power of two is not considered a standard practice in music theory so it is disallowed. EOF will currently allow you to otherwise specify any number between 1 and 256 for the numerator and denominator. If the "Import/Export MIDI TS" option has been enabled in Preferences (see <a href="configure.htm#preferences">Preferences in the Configuring EOF section</a> for details), time signatures are exported to the MIDI that is created during save and are loaded during MIDI import. Setting up a time signature can make it easier to see where you are in the song as each measure begins with a brighter beat line.  Each measure will also have its beat marker labeled with the measure's number in yellow text.<br>
<h1><a name="add">Add</a></h1>
Add a beat to the song and adjust the BPM of the previous anchor to make all the beats fit evenly between the previous anchor and the next. Useful if you have two anchors and you need to add some extra beats in between so there are enough beats to match the music. This function is only available when there is at least one anchor after the selected beat.<br>
<h1><a name="beatdelete">Delete</a></h1>
Delete a beat and adjust the BPM of the previous anchor to make all beats fit evenly between the previous anchor and the next. Useful if you have two anchors and more beats in between them than are actually in the music. Just delete the extra beats and EOF will automatically calculate the correct BPM to make the beat markers fit between the anchors.<br>
<h1><a name="pushoffsetback">Push Offset Back</a></h1>
Move the first beat marker back one beat length based on the BPM of the first beat marker. Useful if the first audible beat occurs after the first note of the song. You can create the tempo map starting where the first beat is audible and after the tempo map is done "Push Offset Back" until the first beat marker occurs before the first note.<br>
<h1><a name="pushoffsetup">Push Offset Up</a></h1>
Delete the first beat marker and make the second beat marker the first (and so forth). Useful if you want to get rid of the first beats of a song (for instance if there is a lot of silence) after you have already synced it.<br>
<h1><a name="resetoffset">Reset Offset to Zero</a></h1>
Inserts a beat at the beginning of the chart to fill in the space being used by the MIDI delay, which is then reset to 0.  All pre-existing notes, beat markers, text events, etc. keep their original positions.  This function is useful for preparing a fully synchronized chart for uses that require a MIDI delay of 0, such as other rhythm games or building for use with Rock Band.
<h1><a name="anchorbeat">Anchor Beat</a></h1>
Anchor the currently selected beat to a specific location. Functions the same as dragging the beat marker to that location.<br>
<h1><a name="toggleanchor">Toggle Anchor</a></h1>
Toggle the currently selected beat between being an anchor and not being an anchor. It can be useful to set anchors every measure or two while creating a tempo map even if the beat marker is in the right location as adjusting a beat marker later in the song will adjust all beats between that beat marker and the previous anchor.<br>
<h1><a name="deleteanchor">Delete Anchor</a></h1>
Delete the currently selected anchor and adjust all beats from the previous anchor to the next so that they fit evenly. If there is no next anchor, the BPM from the previous anchor will be applied to the rest of the song.<br>
<h1><a name="resetbpm">Reset BPM</a></h1>
Delete all anchors and tempo changes, keeping the BPM from the first beat marker throughout the entire song.<br>
<h1><a name="calculatebpm">Calculate BPM</a></h1>
Calculates the BPM based on the selected notes, assuming that the selected notes occur on sequential beats, and applies it to the selected beat marker.<br>
<h1><a name="doublebpm">Double BPM</a></h1>
Doubles the tempo at the selected beat, affecting all beats up to the next tempo change.  This allows an easy way to make beats scroll faster during gameplay while keeping the chart in sync, effectively doubling the number of beat markers present in the affected portion of the chart.  When authoring for Rock Band Network, Magma requires that no tempo is slower than 40 BPM.  This function can help fix a tempo by bringing it above the minimum requirement.<br>
<h1><a name="halvebpm">Halve BPM</a></h1>
Halves the tempo at the selected beat, potentially affecting all beats up to the next tempo change.  This allows an easy way to make beats scroll slower during gameplay while keeping the chart in sync, effectively halving the number of beat markers present in the affected portion of the chart.  In FoF/FoFiX, this will also make existing notes more prone to appearing as HOPO notes in-game, as their proximity is now closer to each other in terms of beat lengths.  Since an odd number of beat markers cannot be cleanly halved, if there are an odd number of beats between the selected beat and the next tempo change, the last beat before the change is anchored and left as-is while the other beats are affected.  This keeps the chart sync intact.  When authoring for Rock Band Network, Magma requires that no tempo is faster than 300 BPM.  This function can help fix a tempo by bringing it below the maximum requirement.<br>
<h1><a name="adjusttempo">Adjust tempo for RBN</a></h1>
Uses the tempo halving and doubling functions to automatically alter the chart tempo whenever it drops below 40 BPM or goes above 300 BPM.  If a halving operation encounters an odd number of beats until the next tempo change, that last beat will have been anchored and will still have the tempo that is above 300BPM.  EOF will alert if this happens, will halt the operation and will seek the chart to the offending beat so that it can be manually resolved by other beat operations such as anchoring the previous beat marker and deleting the problem beat marker, effectively combining the two beats into one beat.  After such a tempo is manually corrected, the function can be used again to finish processing the chart.  If all tempos are within Magma's requirements, EOF will indicate that no tempo adjustments are necessary.<br>
<h1><a name="allevents">All Events</a></h1>
Display all events for the entire song.  You can optionally filter the events that are displayed to only include those that are specific to the active track or those that are section markers (ie. an event beginning with "[section", "section" or "[prc_").  Selecting "Find" in the "All Events" dialog will seek to the beat marker on which the selected event is defined and select that beat so that you can quickly use Beat>Edit to access the event.  See <a href="edit.htm#events">the Events section of Editing Songs</a> for event details.<br>
<h1><a name="events">Events</a></h1>
Display events associated with the selected beat marker for viewing or modification.<br>
<h1><a name="clearevents">Clear Events</a></h1>
Erase all events from the current project.<br>
<h1><a name="trainer">Place Trainer Event</a></h1>
Simplifies the process of adding pro guitar and pro bass training sections when authoring pro guitar content for Rock Band 3.  When a number is entered into the Place Trainer Event dialog's input field, EOF will place a check mark next to each trainer section for that trainer number that already exists in the track, making it easy to avoid duplicate trainer events and typos.  When OK is clicked, EOF will prompt you to confirm placing the event if it would be a duplicate, and the appropriate text event is placed on the selected beat.  As per Rock Band 3's use of these events, both the 17 and 22 fret pro guitar tracks use trainer events from the 17 fret pro guitar track (PART REAL_GUITAR), and both the 17 and 22 fret pro bass tracks use trainer events from the 17 fret pro bass track (PART REAL_BASS).
