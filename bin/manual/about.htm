<h1><a name="About">About EOF</a></h1>

EOF is a song editor for the game “Frets On Fire.” I created EOF because of a personal desire to create my own songs for “Frets On Fire.” When I discovered FOF I quickly took notice of the built-in song editor. Seeing it there in the game's main menu planted a seed of desire in me to create my own songs. I played with it a few times and could never get the editor to create a perfectly synchronized song.
<br><br>
With the seed of desire still in me I sought other means of making songs. Freetar Editor was widely recognized in the FOF community as the most complete editor. I downloaded it and was quickly turned off by the difficulty of getting it to do what I wanted. I gave up on song-making at that point but the seed was still there.
<br><br>
A few months later I heard talk of another song editor, Feedback. I loaded up Feedback and again quickly found that the editor was too difficult to get started with. This was the final straw. I decided to sit down and write my own song editor. I figured that I could create an editor that was easy to use and allowed me to create songs in an intuitive fashion and thus EOF was born.
