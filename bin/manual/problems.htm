<b>Problem:</b><br>
I placed some notes in my song and when I try to play the song in FOF the notes are out of sync.<br><br>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
Make sure you have set up the AV delay properly. To do so, open the “AV Delay” song and start the song (press Space). If the on-screen notes light up before the sound plays you need to adjust the AV delay down (press minus [-]). If the on-screen notes light up after the sound plays you need to adjust the AV delay up (press plus/equal [+/=]). You can adjust while the song is playing also.<br><br>
Also ensure that you have configured your AV delay in "Frets On Fire" properly. To test your AV delay, try playing a song which is reported/accepted as perfectly synced and see if the notes are synced to the audio. If they are not, adjust the AV delay setting and test the song again. Repeat until you find the correct AV delay setting.<br><br>


<b>Problem:</b><br>
I get stuttering or cracking during music playback.<br><br>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
Try adjusting the buffer size. Go to “File->Settings” in the menu. The default value is 4096. Try doubling the value and see if the problem persists. If it is better but not completely fixed, increase the size some more. Note: when adjusting the buffer size, the AV delay will have to be set up again.<br><br>

<b>Problem:</b><br>
When I play the song back the position marker moves faster initially before slowing to normal speed.<br><br>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
There is no way to prevent this from happening as it has to do with the way the OGG file is being played. You will just have to rewind slightly further so that the position marker is moving at the right speed when it hits the note or beat you are trying to sync.
