destroy existing lyrics.

Improved how grid snap works for time signatures other than 4/4.


1.666:

Changed how the tempo map is exported to the MIDI file. The old method could
cause the position of BPM changes to be slightly incorrect leading to inaccurate
placement of notes in the exported MIDI.

Fixed "Toggle Crazy" function.

Improved MIDI import.

Fixed issue with MIDI import missing forced-HOPO notes when there is more than
one note to a forced-HOPO phrase.

beat.

Fixed bug which made newly placed notes not automatically be selected if you
weren't editing PART GUITAR.

Fixed bug which made moving lyric notes behave strangely.

Made some changes to the UI.

Fixed bug which caused EOF to crash when importing a MIDI that doesn't have a
tempo map.

Fixed lefty mode PART_DRUM 3D preview.

Increased maximum note length.

Added PART_VOCALS note editing. Right-click/Insert adds a note, lyric, or
changes the pitch of the clicked note. Scroll wheel changes note length.

MIDI import now imports vocal notes for PART_VOCALS.

Made 3D preview area into a full keyboard when viewing PART_VOCALS. Clicking on
a key will play the note. Right-clicking a key will center the piano roll on
that note.

Added "Vocal Tones" option to the "Edit" menu. This allows you to hear the vocal
notes as they are passed during playback. Also allows you to hear tones as you
are editing. Thanks to raynebc for supplying the piano samples.

Fixed PART_VOCALS phrase marking to adhere to the Rock Band standard. EOF will
now place the beginning of the phrase slightly before the first selected note
and the end of the phrase slightly after the end of the last selected note.

Changed MIDI timing from 100 ticks per beat to 120. Should fix some issues with
incorrect HOPOs in the exported MIDI file.

Forced HOPO options now export correctly to the MIDI file. Before I was writing
a "Note On" event where a "Note Off" event should have been.

Added support for forced HOPOs to the MIDI import function.

Added ability to play a selection. Holding 'S' while starting playback will play
only the time from the beginning of the first selected note to the end of the
last selected note.

Added ability to play a vocal tone by hovering over the piano roll and pressing
the 'P' key.

lyric to be split. Supports multiple splits per lyric.

Made other PART_VOCALS related changes.

Made catalog work with PART_VOCALS.

"Edit->Paste From->Catalog" is now disabled when pasting would cause some notes
to be overwritten.

tracks which could be imported incorrectly as PART_GUITAR.

Right-click context menu (available in RexMundi input mode only) now only
available when right-clicking in the editor pane.

Added tenth-second markers to freatboard display.

Fixed crash bug in Guitar Strum input method.

Fixed "Note->Resnap" deselecting the last selected note.

Fixed importing INI files with unicode text causing data to be truncated.

Added support for mono and non-44100hz OGG playback to mixer. Now everything
should stay synchronized no matter what kind of OGG is loaded (still should be
44100hz stereo to work properly in FoF).

Fixed bug which could cause EOF to crash if you cancelled loading an OGG when
you loaded a chart from a directory that contained no "guitar.ogg" when another
chart was already loaded.


1.62:

Fixed bug which caused the beat lines to be placed incorrectly while dragging a
beat after changing the position of the first beat marker or changing the MIDI
offset.

1.61:

All text is now handled as UTF-8 internally.

Many changes to internal code to allow proper handling of filenames with
unicode characters.

Updated fonts to include characters from 128-255. There should be fewer issues
with song tags when importing MIDI files.

Fixed issue with INI settings containing '=' when importing MIDI files.

The 'T' key no longer activates the "Note->Toggle Crazy" menu item unless there
are notes selected.

MIDI import now properly tags "crazy" notes.

Made OGG, claps, and metronome all mix into the same stream. It should now be
impossible for the claps and metronome to become desynchronized with the music.

BPM adjustments now affect solo and star power sections.

Added new force HOPO options under the "Note" menu. These are currently not
supported by FoFiX (as of 3.120 Final). These are exported using the Rock Band
2 force HOPO notation.

Lyric copy/paste now uses separate clipboard. This prevents some glitches and
makes more sense given that PART_VOCALS is a different kind of track.

Fixed issue with MIDI delta times being calculated incorrectly during MIDI
export. The exported "notes.mid" should be completely accurate now. This should
also improve the viability of EOF as a secondary fretting tool for those who
prefer other tools but need some of EOF's features.

Added new shortcut key ('G') to toggle grid snap. This replaces the old method
of holding Control to disable grid snap.

Fixed glitch with Ctrl+Tab shortcut which could cause multiple tracks to be
marked as selected in the menu.


1.6:

Updated vorbis decoder to latest version.

Unknown INI settings are now imported as custom INI settings when importing a
MIDI.

Implemented new CPU idling system (thanks Kris Asick) which does a better job
giving time back to the OS. EOF should now use only what it needs to run. This
feature is experimental and may be enabled by passing the command line argument
"-newidle" when opening EOF.

Fixed bug in "Song->Catalog->Delete" function which could cause catalog entries
to be corrupted.

Fixed potential yet highly unlikely crash bug when adding new notes.

Modified build system to support 64-bit under Linux (thanks Lystestic).

Improved solo marking.

Added PART_VOCALS editing. Now you can add lyrics to your songs.

Added new drum capabilities. Now, when you are editing PART_DRUM you can fret
by playing the drums while the song is playing. Drum notes will appear at the
grid snap position closest to the current playback position.

Fixed issue which made the AV Delay setting work incorrectly. You should now be
able to sync up the video and audio perfectly again.

Fixed text event issue which could cause EOF to write corrupted MIDI files
under certain circumstances.

Fixed issue which caused "File->Save" to fail after having used "File->Save As"
to save the song.

The "Note->Toggle Crazy" command is now undoable.

Increased maximum custom grid snap interval from 15 to 31.

Fixed potential buffer overrun issues with dialog edit boxes.

A few source fixes for Mac OS X.

Other miscellaneous fixes.


1.59:

In the New Project wizard, the folder name under "Create New Folder" is now
properly filled out with "ARTIST - TITLE" when converting from MP3.

Fixed bug in the New Project wizard which caused the user to have to find and
open "guitar.ogg" manually after the MP3 was converted.

In the New Project wizard, renamed "Use OGG Folder" to "Use Source Audio's
Folder" to avoid confusion.

Fixed bug in "Song->Test In FOF" feature which made it impossible to test
PART_DRUM tracks.

Fixed OGG profile bug which caused the chart elements realign themselves to the
"guitar.ogg" profile even when another profile is currently loaded.

EOF now only deselects all notes when clicking in a blank area if the user is
not holding Shift or Ctrl.

Keyboard buffer is now cleared before showing a dialog.

Backup file is now named after the loaded project. For example, loading
"test.eof" will create a backup of "test.backup.eof" when the time comes to
create a backup file.

Fixed bugs which made it impossible to extend an existing solo or star power
phrase.

Fixed issue with deleting a beat that sits directly between two anchors. Now
the beat is erased and the anchors stay put like they are supposed to.

Added sanity checking to chart loading code to handle charts with corrupted
data from earlier versions, specifically regarding solo and star power
sections.

trinidude4 added support for built-in MP3->OGG conversion on Mac when LAME and
Vorbis tools are installed.

Fixed issue with "Save As" which caused the "File "guitar.ogg" exists.
Replace?" dialog to be confirmed if you pressed Enter in the "Save As" file
dialog, not giving you a chance to select "No."

Fixed issue with undo not marking the chart as modified if the undo was
performed immediately after saving.

Creating a new chart from a file called "guitar.ogg" with the "Use Source
Audio's Folder" option no longer triggers an overwrite prompt for "guitar.ogg."
"notes.eof," "notes.mid," and "song.ini" will still trigger the prompt if they
exist in the folder with "guitar.ogg."

When importing from a MIDI, EOF now imports star power from GH songs as star
power instead of solos.

Improved Solo/Star Power marking logic.

Fixed bug in note auto-adjust code which could cause some notes to be merged in
songs with more than one track.

Added some safeguards against seeking past the end of the audio when using
certain seek commands.

EOF no longer prompts to overwrite "guitar.ogg" when using "Save As" to save a
new ".eof" file in the folder of the currently loaded project.

Fixed bug in New Project wizard which made EOF fail to recreate "guitar.ogg"
when creating a new project from an existing OGG file.

EOF now falls back to loading "guitar.ogg" profile if it fails to load the last
selected profile when loading a new chart.

EOF now resets the OGG profiles when importing a MIDI.

Changed shortcut for "Edit->Selection->Select All" to Ctrl+E.

Added Ctrl+S shortcut for "File->Save."

MIDI export now uses the current OGG profile data when creating the "notes.mid"
file.

Added missing history for v1.58 to "history.txt."


1.58:

Fixed bug in the new project wizard which made it impossible to create a new
song from scratch.

Fixed bug in "song.ini" exporter which made "eighthnote_hopo" option not work.

Fixed bugs in OGG profile handling. The last-used profile is now loaded
automatically.

operations.

Added shortcut key ('T') to toggle crazy notes.

Fixed an omission from the version history under 1.56.


1.56:

EOF no longer creates an initial window before setting up the real window.

Fixed changing window size in the Display dialog not working.

Added initial support for BRE sections. Click the new "BRE" tab to place BRE
notes. Typically a Big Rock Ending is defined by a five-note chord which runs
then length of the BRE section.

Added new Custom Grid Snap setting. Select "Custom" from the Grid Snap menu and
enter the number of snap positions you want per beat. This function is similar
to Feedback's Quantization Interval.

Speed, HOPO view, and Grid Snap settings are now stored in the config file.

Widened the Controller dialog.


1.55:

Added "Use Software Cursor" and "Force 8-Bit Color" options to the display
dialog.

Made EOF use the desktop color depth by default.

The New Project wizard now reads the ARTIST and TITLE tags from the OGG file
and fills in the information automatically. If the information is not available
it is left blank.

Made "Location for New Song" in the New Project wizard default to "Create New
Folder" with the folder filled out as "ARTIST - TITLE" automatically.

Fixed a bug with OGG profiles.

Slightly improved Controllers dialog. Should help users who had issues with not
being able to set up certain fret buttons.

Added GHWT crazy notes support. Notes set as "crazy" ("Note->Toggle Crazy")
will have a black dot in the middle. These notes will not be altered by the
note cleanup code allowing you to make them overlap in odd ways. Note: FOF
doesn't officially support these kinds of notes. Songs may not play as expected
when using "crazy notes."


1.51:

Added command line option "-softmouse" to force EOF to draw it's own mouse
cursor instead of trying to use the system mouse cursor. Use this if you have
issues with the mouse flickering or disappearing.

Fixed issues with OGG profiles which caused the chart to become corrupted under
certain circumstances.

Fixed "history.txt" under version 1.5 regarding the note lengths being slightly
off when using grid snap. This issue was completely resolved and I forgot to
update the history to reflect that.


1.5:

All new internal data structures allow more dynamic handling of memory and
increase the speed of many operations.

EOF will now clean up temporary files it creates during use.

Made editing the catalog undoable.

Input buffer now cleared after all alert dialogs.

Fixed BPM in AVDelay song. Now the beat lines are in sync with the notes.

Fixed note length being too short when grid snap is enabled. Notes will now
stretch all the way to the next snap position like they are supposed.

Fixed Click+Drag on fretboard area when no notes selected causing EOF to mark
the chart as modified.

Made new note graphics for the 3D preview.

Added more information to the "Help->Keys" dialog.

Added support for time signatures. Select a beat marker at the start of a
measure and go to "Beat->Time Signature" on the menu to set the time signature.
This has no effect on the MIDI output and is only there as an aid to editing.

Fixed issue with notes being deleted during a note auto-adjusted when an anchor
was moved.

Invalid menu items are now greyed out when they are not valid to prevent the
user from clicking them and to prevent confusion about what some functions are
for.

Fixed bookmark placement. Bookmarks are no longer affected by the AV Delay
setting.

Added asterisks to indicate which tracks and difficulties contain notes.

Fixed issues with song being marker as modified when no modification occurred.

EOF now imports text events from MIDI files.

EOF now uses the OS mouse cursor when possible.

Added option to load alternate OGG files while working on a project. Useful it
you are working on a song with separated audio.

"Song.ini Generator 2.0."

Fixed bug in edit boxes where text would display incorrectly sometimes if it was
longer than the edit box.

All new tutorial.

Updated user's manual.

New Linux source package is better organized thanks to suggestions made by Ryan
King.

Build instructions are now included in the source package.

Added command line option "-desktop" to make EOF use the same color depth as
the desktop. This could improve performance for some users.

Many other fixes and improvements.


1.42:

Fixed bug in save routine which caused the catalog to become corrupted.

Fixed deleting the only catalog entry and adding another one causing entry
"0 of 1" to be selected. This could cause EOF to crash.

Editing bookmarks is now undoable.

Fixed doing "Beat->Add" causing the last beat in the song to be incorrectly
positioned at 0 milliseconds.


1.41:

Fixed note auto-combine feature erasing notes when it shouldn't.

timestamps and allows you to seek directly to a specific event.

Undo system now caches undo states to disk to conserve memory.

Clipboard now caches notes to disk to conserve memory.

EOF now only uses memory for MIDI import while that feature is in use. This
cuts memory usage significantly.

Made some minor changes to the undo system.

Added "Save As" option to save your project in a new location with whatever
filename you want.

Added options to seek to previous/next screen. Can be accessed through the menu
or by the shortcuts Ctrl+PGUP and Ctrl+PGDN respectively.

Fixed problem where adding a BPM change with "Adjust Notes" selected would
cause notes to be added that shouldn't have been.

Fixed issue where claps wouldn't sound when switching switching difficulties or
tracks during playback.

"Adjust notes to new offset?" dialog now accepts the Y and N keys as shortcuts.

Added "Beat->Add Beat" to add a beat after the selected beat marker and
readjust the bpm of the previous anchor to make all the beat markers fit
evenly.

Added options in the "Beat" menu to push the MIDI offset back/up by one beat.

renders a little faster.

Updated "keys.txt" to bring some new shortcuts to light.

Adjusting the MIDI offset from "Song->Properties" no longer asks you if you
want to adjust notes if there are none.

Added "Note Auto Adjust" option to "Preferences." When it is checked, EOF will
adjust notes when moving anchors and holding Shift while doing so will disable
the note adjustment. Otherwise, holding Shift will enable the note adjustment.
This applies when adjusting the MIDI offset when moving the first beat markaer
as well.

Made changing note lengths and toggling anchors undoable.

Added "Song->INI Settings" menu option. This option allows you to define
additional INI settings for your song.

Catalog now remembers which track the frets are from so they will display
properly when working with multiple tracks.

EOF now remembers the last "frettist" so you don't have to reenter it for every
song you make. You can still change it from "Song->Properties" if you need to.

Notes at the same position are now combined automatically.

Bookmarks and catalog entries now properly adjust when the MIDI offset is
changed and the notes are moved.

and save to the MIDI directly. If you are going to open a MIDI and work on it
during several sessions, you should load the EOF file for subsequent edits to
ensure the note positions stay as accurate as possible.

Pressing Enter to place notes now allows longer notes by holding the Enter key
when the song is playing. If the song is paused, the default note length will
still be applied.
