After a song is opened or created you will need to know how to add, edit, move, and delete notes. The following keys will help you do that:


Playback and Seek controls:

    Space Bar:

        information about the fret catalog).
        
        Hold S when pressing Space to play only the currently selected notes.  Keep S held
        down to cause the selected notes to replay on a loop once the last selected note is
        reached.

        Rewind or Fast Forward song.

        position (when grid snap is disabled).
        
        (If Feedback input method is active, Pg Up/Dn seeks one measure back/forward
         if there is a time signature in effect.)

Note and Beat Editing:

    Right-Click/Insert (notes):

        Add a new note to the song, if Classic, Piano Roll
        or Hold input methods are used.  If SHIFT is held
        while clicking, a newly created note is given a
        a length of 1 millisecond, otherwise the length is
        determined by the current grid snap setting.
    

    Left-Click (notes):

        Select the highlighted note for editing
    
        Hold Ctrl while clicking to select multiple notes
    
        Hold Shift while clicking to select a range of notes


    Middle-Click (notes):

        Open the selected pro guitar notes in the edit pro guitar

        Move selected note(s)

        marker. Surrounding BPMs will be adjusted automatically. An anchor will not move
        unless dragged, nonanchor beats will adjust to fit.
    
        Hold Shift when dragging a beat to prevent the notes within from being adjusted with

    Ctrl+~ , Ctrl+#, Ctrl+Fn #, Ctrl+X:

        Changes the fret number for all gems of all selected notes to 0 (Ctrl+~), 1 through 10 (Ctrl+1 through 0), or 11 through 22 (Ctrl+F1 through F12), or X (Ctrl+X, to denote string mutes).
