After a song is opened or created you will need to know how to add, edit, move, and delete notes. The following keys will help you do that:


Playback and Seek controls:

    Space Bar:

        Play/Pause the currently loaded song
    
        Hold Ctrl when pressing Space to play at 50% speed
    
        Hold Shift when pressing Space to play the current fret catalog entry (see manual for
        information about the fret catalog).
        
        Hold S when pressing Space to play only the currently selected notes.
    

    Left/Right Arrow:

        Rewind or Fast Forward song
    
        Hold Ctrl while pressing to move slowly
    
        Hold Shift while pressing to move quickly
    

    Page Up/Page Down:

        Move to the previous/next beat marker
    
        Hold Ctrl while pressing to seek to previous/next screen
    
        Hold Shift while pressing to seek to previous/next note
        
        
    Numpad 0-9:
    
        Seek to the desired bookmark
        
        Hold Ctrl while pressing to place the desired bookmark at the current position

        Toggle metronome.
    

    K:

        Toggle claps.
    
    
    V:
    
        Toggle vocal tones.
    

    ;/' (Semicolon/Apostrophe):

        Adjust audio playback rate.


Note and Beat Editing:

    Right-Click/Insert (notes):

        Add a new note to the song
    

    Left-Click (notes):

        Select the highlighted note for editing
    
        Hold Ctrl while clicking to select multiple notes
    
        Hold Shift while clicking to select a range of notes
    

    Left-Click+Drag (notes):

        Move selected note(s)
    

    Mouse Wheel:

        Move up and down to lengthen or shorten the selected note
    
        You can also press the '[]' keys to do the same
    

    Up/Down:

        Transpose selected notes up/down.
    

    Left-Click (beats):

        Select the highlighted beat
    

    Left-Click+Drag (beats):

        Move the beat marker. An anchor is automatically created when you move a beat
        marker. Surrounding BPMs will be adjusted automatically. An anchor will not move
        unless dragged, nonanchor beats will adjust to fit.
    
        Hold Shift when dragging a beat to prevent the notes within from being adjusted with
        the beat markers. Useful if you are beat syncing someone elses songs, for instance. Shift
        has opposite effect when the "Note Auto-Adjust" preference is turned off.

        reverse.

        Cycle through grid snap settings.
