        Move selected note(s)
    

    Mouse Wheel:

        Move up and down to lengthen or shorten the selected note
    
        You can also press the '[]' keys to do the same

	Turn off Grid Snap and hold Shift while lengthening/shortening for small adjustments.

        marker. Surrounding BPMs will be adjusted automatically. An anchor will not move
        unless dragged, nonanchor beats will adjust to fit.
